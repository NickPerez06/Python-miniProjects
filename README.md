# Python-miniProjects

This repo will publish python mini-projects from courses taken from coursera. Each Project written, will be entirly
of my own writing. The projects are written inside of CodeSkulpter becuase the course requires it. However, over time
I will transfer them to this repo. Note: CodeSkulpter uses libraries that only exist in that IDE. Some projects will have to
be reworked to work outside of it (I.E pygame). Over the next few weeks, some projects will be rewritten using pygame
since after this initial commit, the remaining projects wont fucntion outside of codeskulpter. I will decide if I want to push
the original codeskulpter work or the pygame rework. I may do both.
